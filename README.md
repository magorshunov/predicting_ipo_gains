# Predicting Listing Gains in the Indian IPO Market Using TensorFlow
I build a deep learning classification model using TensorFlow to predict listing gains for the Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in the Indian market. The model development process is described in the Jupyter Notebook `predicting_ipo_gains.ipynb`. The dataset is available under the file name `data.csv`.
